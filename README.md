This project predicts heart disease using a neural network model. It uses a dataset of 303 patients from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, focusing on 14 key health attributes like blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, and age.

We’ll use Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data processing, and scikit-learn and keras for building and training the model.

The dataset, available here, contains medical records collected from the Cleveland Clinic and other hospitals. It’s widely used for studying heart disease prediction.
